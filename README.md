# PasswordManager
A secure password manager to add your accounts, with encryption key to import.

All the fonctionnality are almost done, the biggest work now is on the UI, I'm transforming it with material design.

I will make a documentation when I think the application can be use by everyone with safety and easy use.


## Current fonctionnality

The application contain the
interfaces and fonctionnalities to:
- Register / Connect
- Add account with a encryption key (for now hardly encode, will change soon)
- Create / Update /Delete password into the password manager
- Copy user / password to the clipboard
- Save the list of passwords of the password manager to a text file
- Filter the list of passwords by name / description / login
